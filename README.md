# Illue-Wiz

Illue-Wiz is a Qt-based C++ program designed to calculate the characteristics of LED luminaires. This tool allows users to easily select LED modules and drivers, check for compatibility, and calculate various parameters related to luminous flux, LED voltage, LED power, effective lumens, and overall efficiency.

## Features

- Select LED modules from a predefined list.
- Choose LED drivers from a list of supported drivers.
- Check compatibility between selected LED modules and drivers.
- Calculate luminous flux, LED voltage, LED power, effective lumens, and overall efficiency.
- View the results in a table format.
- Choose current intervals or fine-tune the luminaire using a slider with 1mA steps.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
